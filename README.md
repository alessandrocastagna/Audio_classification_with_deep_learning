# Audio_classification_with_deep_learning

The aim of the project is to make audio classifications of urban sounds. The audios are divided into 15 categories, as follows:
- Bus
- Cafe / Restaurant
- Car
- City center
- Forest path
- Grocery store
- Home
- Lakeside beach
- Library
- Metro station
- Office
- Residential area
- Train
- Tram
- Urban park

For this goal two classification methods were used using deep learning, for each of which a file was created (you can found them in this repository):
- Classification with Audio Feature extraction "MFCC", using a Feed Forward Neural Network (MFCC_classification.ipynb)
- Classification with Audio Spectogram, using a Convultional Neural Network (CNN) (New_UrbanSounds.ipynb)

In addiction, at the end of MFCC file you can find the application of Transfer learning on data.
